# RPG Adventure Flavour Pack - Fork

If you like my stuff, feel free buy me a coffee (or a beer) at ko-fi.com/joeownage

This is a custom fork of Mr Samuel Streamer's RPG Adventure Flavour Pack. I've spent a fair bit of time patching this mod and I thought it made sense to properly fork it in case Feldoh's mod is taken down or changed significantly.

I made this for my own modpack: 

Joe's 1.5 Playtested Medieval Fantasy Modlist and Configs

**Changes:**  
----
  
- All alcoholic beverages (except *Medieval Overhaul* wine, for now) from *Core Rimworld*, *Medieval Overhaul*, *House Roxmont*, *Mashed's Ashlands*, and *Stoneborn Delights* will restore 5% psyfocus (mana) if *Rimworld: Royalty* is loaded.  
  
**RPG ADVENTURE FLAVOUR PACK**:
- Commented out WizardTales xenotypes, you'd need to add a number of additional gene mods, which are not in my modpack, to get them to work as intended:  
    1. Turnovus' "Integrated Genes"  
    2. GwenBlanketSpecter's "Meditation Traits and Genes"  
    3. Danzen's "Vanilla Psycast Expanded - Biotech Integration"  
    4. LTS's "Glowing eyes genes"  
    5. 6262soudai's "VPE-Biotech Integration for Alpha Animals and More!"
- Changed spawn rate of Broombug to be more rare.
- Librarian trader caravan now sells all *Medieval Overhaul* books, but will not always have them all available. (except for intermediate cooking, I couldn't add that one for some reason - will be added in the future)
- Replaced references to Oken's *Medieval Quest Rewards* with Botch Job's *Medieval Fantasy Themed Quest Rewards* (uses patched base game defs).
- Changed Wizard's Boots and Gloves to rely on *Medieval Overhaul* instead of *Vanilla Apparel Expanded*
- Commented out code for Deeper Darker Mineshaft as for some reason it had no recipes for me, and I've been putting the mining recipes I want on the regular *MO* mineshaft anyway.  
- Commented out references to *Medieval Overhaul* defs: DankPyon_Book_AncientCodex, DankPyon_Book_IntoTheRuins, DankPyon_Book_TheBeginning. (causing errors).

**MEDIEVAL OVERHAUL**:

- Traveling Apothecary Artificer caravan added to MO Noble Houses that sells small quantities of:
    1. *Medieval Med: MO Edition* prosthetics and medicine
    2. *Medieval Overhaul* drugs, medicine, gems
    3. Heartstone from *Asimov* for building Warforged from *Forgotten Realms*.
    4. more
- Grimoires will appear in lootable bookshelves in *Medieval Overhaul* hideouts and ruins if *Grimoires* mod is loaded.
- Added ability to mine raw mithril (plasteel) at *Medieval Overhaul* mine.    
- Added ability to mine raw oricalcum (uranium) at *Medieval Overhaul* mine and refine it into ingots at the furnace.  
- Added ability to mine raw pyrinth at *Medieval Overhaul* mine if *Epochs: Pyrinth* is loaded.
- Nerfed the amount of tanning liquor the Medieval Overhaul tanning rack uses.
- Put *Stargates!* (arcane portals) recipes on the *Medieval Overhaul* furnace. Changed its recipes and costlists to use *Medieval Overhaul* components. If *Rimfantasy* mod is loaded, recipes will appear on the arcane crafting bench instead.   

**[CZK] EYE PROSTHETICS (CONTINUED)**:
- Changed research to align with *Medieval Overhaul*.
- Changed regular eyepatch recipe use cloth or *Medieval Overhaul*'s linen.  
- Changed glass eye recipe to use glass from *Rebuild: Doors and Corners* if mod is loaded.  

**MEDIEVAL MEDICINES: MEDIEVAL OVERHAUL EDITION**:
- Removed eye patch if *[CZK] Eye Prosthetics (Continued)* is loaded.
- Cryptosleep casket patch now applies if this mod is loaded.

**STARGATES!**:  
- Changed research for **Stargates!** (arcane portals) to Medieval tech level. 

**XENOTYPES**:
- Added no-facial-animations gene from Big & Small to certain modded xenotypes where the animations don't look right. As I encounter more, I will add them.
- Added Tordune subspecies to Loxodon xenotype if *FRBE Loxo* is loaded. Adds a new head type and a new gene.  
- Made Loxodon pawnkinds from *FRBE Loxo* not wear headgear (doesn't fit).
- Made Loxodon xenotype from *FRBE Loxo* not spawn in base game factions for now (will re-add with pawnkinds so they don't spawn with headgear).
- Warforged should spawn with a xenotype now instead of as a baseliner (still testing)
  
**ISSUES:**
