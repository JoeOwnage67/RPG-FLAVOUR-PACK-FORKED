# RPG Adventure Flavour Pack - Fork

This is a custom fork of Mr Samuel Streamer's RPG Adventure Flavour Pack. Not much is changed from the current Github version, I've just spent a fair bit of time patching this mod and I thought it made sense to have my own fork of it available in case Dexter Feldoh changes his version and messes up all my patches.

**Changes:**  
----
- Commented out code for Deeper Darker Mineshaft as for some reason it had no recipes for me, and I've been putting the mining recipes I want on the regular MO mineshaft anyway.  
- Commented out references to Medieval Overhaul defs: DankPyon_Book_AncientCodex, DankPyon_Book_IntoTheRuins, DankPyon_Book_TheBeginning. (causing errors).  
- Commented out WizardTales xenotypes, you'd need to add a number of additional gene mods, which are not in my modpack, to get them to work as intended:  
    1. Turnovus' "Integrated Genes"  
    2. GwenBlanketSpecter's "Meditation Traits and Genes"  
    3. Danzen's "Vanilla Psycast Expanded - Biotech Integration"  
    4. LTS's "Glowing eyes genes"  
    5. 6262soudai's "VPE-Biotech Integration for Alpha Animals and More!"
