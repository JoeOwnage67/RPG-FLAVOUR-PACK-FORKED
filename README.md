# RPG Adventure Flavour Pack - Fork

This is a custom fork of Mr Samuel Streamer's RPG Adventure Flavour Pack. I've spent a fair bit of time patching this mod and I thought it made sense to properly fork it in case the main mod sees big changes.

**Changes:**  
----
- Commented out code for Deeper Darker Mineshaft as for some reason it had no recipes for me, and I've been putting the mining recipes I want on the regular MO mineshaft anyway.  
- Commented out references to Medieval Overhaul defs: DankPyon_Book_AncientCodex, DankPyon_Book_IntoTheRuins, DankPyon_Book_TheBeginning. (causing errors).  
- Commented out WizardTales xenotypes, you'd need to add a number of additional gene mods, which are not in my modpack, to get them to work as intended:  
    1. Turnovus' "Integrated Genes"  
    2. GwenBlanketSpecter's "Meditation Traits and Genes"  
    3. Danzen's "Vanilla Psycast Expanded - Biotech Integration"  
    4. LTS's "Glowing eyes genes"  
    5. 6262soudai's "VPE-Biotech Integration for Alpha Animals and More!"
- Changed spawn rate of Broombug to be more rare.
- Librarian trader caravan now sells all Medieval Overhaul books, but will not always have them all available. (except for intermediate cooking, I couldn't add that one for some reason)
- Traveling Apothecary Artificer caravan added to MO Noble Houses that sells small quantities of:
    1. Medieval Med: MO Edition prosthetics and medicine
    2. Medieval Overhaul drugs, medicine, gems
    3. Heartstone from Asimov for building Warforged from Forgotten Realms.
    4. more  
- Added no-facial-animations gene from Big & Small to certain modded xenotypes where the animations don't look right. As I encounter more, I will add them.
- Replaced references to Oken's Medieval Quest Rewards with Botch Job's (uses patched base game defs).
